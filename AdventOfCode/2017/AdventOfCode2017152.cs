    /// 
    /// --- Part Two ---
    /// 
    /// In the interest of trying to align a little better, the generators get more
    /// picky about the numbers they actually give to the judge.
    /// 
    /// They still generate values in the same way, but now they only hand a value
    /// to the judge when it meets their criteria:
    /// 
    ///     Generator A looks for values that are multiples of 4.
    ///     Generator B looks for values that are multiples of 8.
    /// 
    /// Each generator functions completely independently: they both go through
    /// values entirely on their own, only occasionally handing an acceptable value
    /// to the judge, and otherwise working through the same sequence of values as
    /// before until they find one.
    /// 
    /// The judge still waits for each generator to provide it with a value before
    /// comparing them (using the same comparison method as before). It keeps track
    /// of the order it receives values; the first values from each generator are
    /// compared, then the second values from each generator, then the third
    /// values, and so on.
    /// 
    /// Using the example starting values given above, the generators now produce
    /// the following first five values each:
    /// 
    /// --Gen. A--  --Gen. B--
    /// 1352636452  1233683848
    /// 1992081072   862516352
    ///  530830436  1159784568
    /// 1980017072  1616057672
    ///  740335192   412269392
    /// 
    /// These values have the following corresponding binary values:
    /// 
    /// 01010000100111111001100000100100
    /// 01001001100010001000010110001000
    /// 
    /// 01110110101111001011111010110000
    /// 00110011011010001111010010000000
    /// 
    /// 00011111101000111101010001100100
    /// 01000101001000001110100001111000

    /// 00011000100100101011101101010000
    /// 
    /// Unfortunately, even though this change makes more bits similar on average,
    /// none of these values' lowest 16 bits match. Now, it's not until the 1056th
    /// pair that the judge finds the first match:
    /// 
    /// --Gen. A--  --Gen. B--
    /// 1023762912   896885216
    ///

    /// 00110101011101010110000111100000
    /// 
    /// This change makes the generators much slower, and the judge is getting
    /// impatient; it is now only willing to consider 5 million pairs. (Using the
    /// values from the example above, after five million pairs, the judge would
    /// eventually find a total of 309 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)
    /// 
    /// After 5 million pairs, but using this new generator logic, what is the
    /// judge's final count?
