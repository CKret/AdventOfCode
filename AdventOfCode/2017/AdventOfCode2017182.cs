    /// As you congratulate yourself for a job well done, you notice that the
    /// documentation has been on the back of the tablet this entire time. While
    /// you actually got most of the instructions correct, there are a few key
    /// differences. This assembly code isn't about sound at all - it's meant to be
    /// run twice at the same time.
    /// 
    /// Each running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows
    /// the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run
    /// at the same speed. To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv)
    /// instructions:
    /// 
    ///     - snd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in
    ///       a queue until that program is ready to receive them. Each program has
    ///       its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it
    ///       sent.
    ///     - rcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no
    ///       values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to
    ///       it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have
    ///       received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.
    /// 
    /// Each program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1);
    /// the register p should begin with this value.
    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// 
    /// snd 1
    /// snd 2
    /// snd p
    /// rcv a
    /// rcv b
    /// rcv c
    /// rcv d
    /// 
    /// Both programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends
    /// 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both
    /// 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b,
    /// and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0
    /// receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees
    /// a different value in its own copy of register c.
    /// 
    /// Finally, both programs try to rcv a fourth time, but no data is waiting for
    /// either of them, and they reach a deadlock. When this happens, both programs
    /// terminate.
    /// 
    /// It should be noted that it would be equally valid for the programs to run
    /// at different speeds; for example, program 0 might have sent all three
    /// values and then stopped at the first rcv before program 1 executed even its
    /// first instruction.
    /// 
    /// Once both of your programs have terminated (regardless of what caused them
    /// to do so), how many times did program 1 send a value?
